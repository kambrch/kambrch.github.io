# First post
I’m starting this blog to keep track of what I’m learning and thinking about. Most of it will probably be notes from whatever I’m currently obsessed with—usually physics, chemistry, or some bit of history that derails my day. Sometimes it’ll be technical, sometimes just personal reflection.

I’m building this site in Julia with Franklin.jl and inside Neovim editor. This setup is very simple, but this simplicity seems to work very fine for me. For some reason, creating a page in Markdown has a better flow for me than using WYSIWYG editors. 

This is mostly for me, but if someone else finds it useful or interesting, that’s a bonus. Posts will appear whenever I find something interesting enough to think about and write something in my editor.
