# About me

My name is Kamil Bruchal, however  I usually go by nicknames *Kamaś* (Kamash) and *Kambr*. I'm a physicist (WUST graduate), amateur chemist, hacker, and perpetual learner. I'm based in Wrocław, Poland. 

When I’m not in the lab or in Julia REPL, I’m usually at Hackerspace or on the air as SP6WRN.

Currently I'm looking for interesting work opportunities in experimental physics, software development, RF/electronics, or data science.
