## About

I come from a scientific and computational background, with experience working at the boundary between research and engineering. Much of my work involves taking exploratory code, numerical models, or ad-hoc data workflows and turning them into **reliable, maintainable software systems**.

In addition to R&D-focused projects, I am **available for general data-oriented and software development work**, including internal tools, backend systems, and improvements to existing codebases—especially where performance, correctness, or technical debt are concerns.

I work directly with clients, keep assumptions explicit, and aim to deliver solutions that can be understood and maintained without ongoing external dependency.

## Typical Problems I Solve

- Research or prototype code that cannot be scaled or maintained  
- Data pipelines that rely on manual steps or undocumented scripts  
- Numerical models that are slow, unstable, or difficult to validate  
- Machine learning projects without reproducibility or a clear deployment path  
- Inefficient or fragile HPC or cloud compute setups  
- R&D results that cannot be cleanly transferred into production systems  

## Expertise Areas

### Data Engineering
- Design and implementation of reliable data pipelines  
- ETL/ELT processes and data warehousing  
- Cloud and hybrid data architectures  
- Batch and streaming data processing systems  

### Data Science
- Statistical analysis and predictive modeling  
- Machine learning workflows with reproducibility and evaluation discipline  
- Feature engineering, dataset construction, and experiment tracking  
- Model deployment integration (when needed)  

### Scientific Computing
- Numerical simulations and model implementation  
- Performance optimization (vectorization, parallelism, profiling)  
- High-performance computing workflows  
- Reproducible computational research tooling  

### Software Development
- Backend systems and internal tooling  
- API design and automation  
- Codebase refactoring and technical debt reduction  
- Testing and CI practices for scientific / data-heavy code  

## Tools & Stack (typical)
- Python, Julia  
- NumPy/SciPy, Pandas, Polars  
- SQL, DuckDB, Postgres  
- Docker, CI/CD  
- HPC environments, Linux tooling  

## Engagement

I typically work in one of these modes:
- **Audit / assessment:** identify failure modes, bottlenecks, and a realistic roadmap  
- **Implementation:** build or refactor the system, with tests and documentation  
- **Support:** short-term help for a specific hard problem (performance, correctness, migration)
