# KAMSOFT

Independent consulting in **data engineering**, **scientific computing**, and **software development**  
for research-driven companies and individual clients.

I work on computational and data-oriented problems that require correctness, reproducibility,  
and long-term maintainability rather than quick demonstrations.

## About

I come from a scientific and computational background, with experience working at the boundary between research and engineering. Much of my work involves taking exploratory code, numerical models, or ad-hoc data workflows and turning them into **reliable, maintainable software systems**.

In addition to R&D-focused projects, I am **available for general data-oriented and software development work**, including internal tools, backend systems, and improvements to existing codebases—especially where performance, correctness, or technical debt are concerns.

I work directly with clients, keep assumptions explicit, and aim to deliver solutions that can be understood and maintained without ongoing external dependency.

## Typical Problems I Solve

- Research or prototype code that cannot be scaled or maintained  
- Data pipelines that rely on manual steps or undocumented scripts  
- Numerical models that are slow, unstable, or difficult to validate  
- Machine learning projects without reproducibility or a clear deployment path  
- Inefficient or fragile HPC or cloud compute setups  
- R&D results that cannot be cleanly transferred into production systems  

## Expertise Areas

### Data Engineering
- Design and implementation of reliable data pipelines  
- ETL/ELT processes and data warehousing  
- Cloud and hybrid data architectures  
- Batch and streaming data processing systems  

### Data Science
- Statistical analysis and predictive modeling  
- Machine learning model development with an emphasis on validation  
- Experiment design and A/B testing  
- Decision-oriented data visualization and reporting  

### Scientific Computing
- High-performance and parallel computing  
- Numerical simulation and mathematical modeling  
- Scientific and research software development  
- Computational support for R&D and applied research  

## Services

I offer collaboration in the following forms:
- **Technical Partnerships**: Long-term collaboration with R&D-heavy or data-driven organizations  
- **Individual Consulting**: Project-based work for researchers, engineers, and independent professionals  
- **Custom Development**: Tailored solutions for non-standard computational or data problems  

## Collaboration Approach

I focus on building systems that are technically sound, transparent in their assumptions, and practical to maintain. My work favors simple, defensible solutions over unnecessary complexity, and I am direct about trade-offs and limitations.

## Get in Touch

If your data, models, or computational infrastructure are becoming a bottleneck rather than a tool, feel free to get in touch to discuss your project.
